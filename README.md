### Project Overview

 The most entertaining(and satisfying) way to improve your skills in a programming language is by doing challenges. Every challenge that is given in this assessment module can be solved by a bit of python programming and logical thinking.

Some challenges may look easy, some may look tough but we hope you solve them all with the same vigour.

All the best.
